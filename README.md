This script allows a user to send their local Medal files to another local pc and have them automatically imported into the app, as a way to back up or restore medal when moving computers. 
Typically, you'd need to back up everything normally and move around all the files and just hoping you dont't mess anything up.

Everything is non-destructive for the sender, so if something goes wrong during the transfer all your original files are still safe. After moving everything and confirming it all worked you can purge the old ones or whatever you'd like.

Script runs completely over local network and requires no passwords or API tokens or anything of the sort. Script must be run on both devices at the same time. 
It can take a little bit for larger amounts of files to be compressed (the video files can get quite massive), but transfer speeds are pretty quick (I consistently get 40Mbps but it depends on network conditions)

After the script finalizes you may need to log out of medal and log back in and/or restart your client for the new changes to take place. It might take a bit for all the new files to reflect in-client.
